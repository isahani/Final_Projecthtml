            <h2>About Chef Roshni</h2>
            <p>I have had the love of cooking since I was a child helping my Mother in the kitchen. She was a beautiful cook
                and always shared her love for it with our family. My Mom also taught me how to cook the many Indian and
                Italian dishes we all loved to eat. My love for sharing my cooking with others is what led me to teaching
                the joy of sharing a meal with friends and family. I have over 15 years experience in the food Industry.
                Studied at the Institute of Hotel management, catering and nutrition, New Delhi, India. I believe,
                "Combining the flavors of many cultures results in an explosion of taste delights". I hope you will join me
                for one of the many culinary experiences offered.
            </p>
